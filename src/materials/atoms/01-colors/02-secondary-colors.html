notes: |
    These are accent colors to provide additional lightness and style to pages
    looking for a more modern flair. These colors should be used to highlight
    important features on a page, such as buttons, or for visual style
    elements, such as illustrations. They should be used sparingly and never
    draw the eye to more than one piece of information at a time.

    You can use `.vd-u-color-text--*` to set the color of texts.
