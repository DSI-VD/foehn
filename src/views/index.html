<h1>Fœhn</h1>

<p>This UI foehn is a highly-modular design system for rapid web page development. It contains different materials that can be assembled into more complex page layouts.</p>

<p>This guide contains real working examples, code snippets, documentation, and style guidelines.</p>

<h2>Usage</h2>

<p>Start by adding the following files to your page:</p>

<pre class="language-markup"><code class="language-markup">&lt;link rel=&quot;stylesheet&quot; href=&quot;assets/foehn/styles/foehn.css&quot;&gt;</code></pre>

<pre class="language-markup"><code class="language-markup">&lt;script src=&quot;assets/foehn/scripts/foehn.js&quot;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;</code></pre>

<h2>Methodology</h2>

<p>Fœhn is based on the <a href="http://bradfrost.com/blog/post/atomic-web-design/">Atomic Design</a> methodology by <a href="https://twitter.com/brad_frost">Brad Frost</a>.</p>

<p>There are five distinct levels in atomic design:</p>
<ol>
    <li><a href="atoms.html">Atoms</a>: Atoms are the basic building blocks of matter. Applied to web interfaces, atoms are our HTML tags, such as a form label, an input or a button.</li>
    <li><a href="molecules.html">Molecules</a>: Molecules are groups of atoms bonded together and are the smallest fundamental units of a compound. These molecules take on their own properties and serve as the backbone of our design systems.</li>
    <li><a href="organisms.html">Organisms</a>: Organisms are groups of molecules joined together to form a relatively complex, distinct section of an interface.</li>
    <li><a href="templates.html">Templates</a>: Templates consist mostly of groups of organisms stitched together to form pages. It’s here where we start to see the design coming together and start seeing things like layout in action.</li>
    <li><a href="pages.html">Pages</a>: Pages are specific instances of templates. Here, placeholder content is replaced with real representative content to give an accurate depiction of what a user will ultimately see.</li>
</ol>
